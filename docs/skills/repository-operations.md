# Repository Operations

## Package Boundaries

This is a Poetry-managed Python monorepo. Work from the affected package directory for package-local dependency resolution and tests. Use root Invoke tasks only for documented cross-package operations.

- `action_server/`: CLI, FastAPI service, frontend, build and bundled RCC.
- `actions/`, `mcp/`: agent-facing action and MCP libraries.
- `work-items/`: producer/consumer library and storage adapters.
- `common/`, `build_common/`, `devutils/`: shared runtime, build, and development utilities.
- `templates/`: generated package/workflow sources; changes require template-level regression coverage.

## Evidence Ladder

Prefer evidence in this order:

1. Current executable tests and source behavior.
2. Package configuration and CI workflows.
3. Current public documentation.
4. Historical commits/design notes, labeled as intent rather than delivered behavior.
5. External upstream documentation pinned to the inspected version.

Do not convert a commit message, design proposal, or skipped test into a current-behavior claim.

## Development Loop

1. Inspect branch/status and package configuration.
2. Reproduce the failure or establish a clean baseline.
3. Add a regression before behavioral code.
4. Implement the smallest scoped change.
5. Run focused tests, package suite, configured lint/type checks, and `git diff --check`.
6. Update the relevant canonical guide with the durable learning and evidence.
7. Commit one logical change with a Conventional Commit prefix.

When Poetry is unavailable, report that limitation. A temporary `uv` environment may provide diagnostic evidence, but it does not replace the package's Poetry/CI release gate. When Docker is available, rebuild and use the repository Dev Container image for the Poetry release path rather than treating a host-tool fallback as terminal evidence.

A Dev Container counts as release evidence only after its repository-owned configuration builds headlessly and the declared in-container Poetry gate passes. A mutable image reference or successful editor attachment alone is not verification.

The Action Server Dev Container uses uv only to install and cache Poetry; Poetry and committed `poetry.lock` files remain the dependency-resolution and release authorities. The image declares the uv, Poetry, and npm cache paths and creates them as `vscode` before the runtime user switch, so newly created named volumes are writable. Bootstrap uses `poetry sync --no-interaction`. Build and use the Task 2 image headlessly from the repository root:

```bash
docker build --pull=false -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile -t actions-devcontainer:task-2 .
docker run --rm --user vscode -v "$PWD:/workspaces/actions" -w /workspaces/actions actions-devcontainer:task-2 .devcontainer/bin/bootstrap
docker run --rm --user vscode -v "$PWD:/workspaces/actions" -w /workspaces/actions actions-devcontainer:task-2 .devcontainer/bin/verify-work-items
```

If dependency cache state is corrupt, remove only the named Dev Container cache volumes, then rebuild the image and rerun bootstrap:

```bash
docker volume rm actions-uv-cache actions-poetry-cache actions-npm-cache
docker build --pull=false -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile -t actions-devcontainer:task-2 .
```

Run the dependency-free static configuration gate with unittest discovery because `.devcontainer` is not a valid Python module name:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s .devcontainer/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

## Delegated Lanes

Every dispatch includes the mandatory documentation receipt from root `AGENTS.md`. Mutating lanes update canonical guidance in their branch when write scopes permit. Read-only or isolated lanes propose an exact delta. The integration lane records rejected proposals and the reason; silent discard is forbidden.

## Verification Receipts

Final reports list exact commands and outcomes, external/service tests skipped, environments not exercised, documentation improvements, and remaining uncertainty. “Tests pass” without fresh output is not evidence.

## Pull Request Triage

Resolve both the local `origin` repository and any `upstream` repository before listing pull requests. Compare open PR head/base branches and changed-file intersections against the intended local base; do not classify a PR as superseded from its title or a different repository's PR list alone.
