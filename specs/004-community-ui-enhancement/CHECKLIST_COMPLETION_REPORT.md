## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 🚨 Blockers (Must Fix Before Implementation)

**Priority: P0 - Address Before Starting Implementation**

1. **CHK010** - Not all component states documented for each component
   - **Impact**: Developers won't know what states to implement for Table, Dialog, DropdownMenu
   - **Fix**: Add explicit state enumeration (base, hover, focus, disabled, error) to FR-COMP-006, FR-COMP-010
   
2. **CHK037** - ARIA attributes not specified for custom interactive components
   - **Impact**: Accessibility tests will fail; screen reader users blocked
   - **Fix**: Add FR-A11Y-001 requirement specifying required ARIA attributes per component

3. **CHK088** - Accessibility interaction scenarios missing
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate keyboard-only or screen reader workflows
   - **Fix**: Add User Story 7 "Navigate with Keyboard/Screen Reader"

4. **CHK089** - Mobile viewport interaction scenarios missing
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate touch interactions on 375px viewport
   - **Fix**: Add acceptance scenarios for mobile touch patterns in existing stories

### ⚠️ High Priority (Fix During Phase 1)

**Priority: P1 - Address During Component Development**

5. **CHK011** - HTML input types not enumerated
   - **Impact**: Unclear which input types must be styled
   - **Fix**: Update FR-COMP-001 with list: text, email, password, number, search, tel, url

6. **CHK020** - TypeScript interfaces not specified
   - **Impact**: No contract validation for component props
   - **Fix**: Add FR-COMP-016 requiring TypeScript interfaces for all components

7. **CHK023** - GPU-accelerated animation properties not defined
   - **Impact**: Risk of janky animations on lower-end devices
   - **Fix**: Add FR-UI-025 requiring transform/opacity only (no width/height/margin animations)

8. **CHK030** - CSS purging/tree-shaking not explicitly defined
   - **Impact**: Bundle size might exceed 350KB limit
   - **Fix**: Add FR-BUILD-001 requiring Tailwind purge configuration

9. **CHK051-055** - Animation easing curves, frame rates not specified (5 items)
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent animation feel; no performance target
   - **Fix**: Add FR-UI-026 defining easing (ease-in-out default, 60fps target)

10. **CHK101** - Screen reader user flows not explicitly defined
    - **Impact**: Cannot test screen reader experience
    - **Fix**: Add acceptance scenario to User Story addressing screen readers

## Ambiguities Requiring Clarification

### 🔍 Terminology Needing Quantification

**Priority: P1 - Clarify During Implementation**

| CHK | Term | Current Usage | Needs Definition |
|-----|------|---------------|------------------|
| CHK041 | "smooth transition" | FR-UI-004 | Specify easing function (e.g., `ease-in-out`) |
| CHK042 | "clear visual separation" | Dialog header/footer | Quantify: "1px border + 16px padding" |
| CHK044 | "prominent" | General UI | Define: "z-index >10" or "bold font-weight" |
| CHK045 | "professional polish" | User Story 6 | Define: "4/5 user rating" (already in SC-012) |
| CHK048 | "functional elegance" | Assumptions | Define: "minimal decoration, max usability" |
| CHK049 | "actionable call-to-action" | FR-UI-008 | Specify: "primary Button variant" |
| CHK050 | "properly aligned" | Dropdown icons | Specify: "flexbox center" or "12px right margin" |
| CHK154 | "professional" | Throughout | Standardize: "4.5:1 contrast, smooth transitions, consistent spacing" |
| CHK155 | "smooth" | Throughout | Standardize: "200ms ease-in-out, 60fps" |
| CHK156 | "clear" | Throughout | Standardize: "4.5:1 contrast, distinct visual hierarchy" |
| CHK158 | "standard connection" | SC-014, SC-015 | Quantify: "3G network (3 Mbps, 50ms latency)" |

## Non-Critical Gaps (Defer to Post-Release)

### 📝 Maintainability & Documentation (P2)

- **CHK127**: Code organization requirements not formally defined
- **CHK128**: TypeScript strict mode not specified
- **CHK129**: Component documentation requirements missing

**Rationale**: These improve developer experience but don't block user-facing features. Can be addressed in refactoring phase.

### 🔒 Extended Security (P2)

- **CHK124**: JSON injection prevention not explicitly addressed
- **CHK125**: CSP requirements not defined

**Rationale**: FR-SEC-001 (React JSX escaping) provides baseline protection. Advanced security can be added in hardening phase.

### 📱 Extended Compatibility (P2)

- **CHK132**: Mobile browser compatibility (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) not specified
- **CHK133**: Responsive breakpoints not formally defined
- **CHK134**: Backwards compatibility not formally defined

**Rationale**: Assumptions cover modern browsers. Extended compatibility can be validated in cross-browser testing phase.

### 📊 Observability (P2)

- **CHK135**: Logging requirements not defined
- **CHK136**: Error boundaries not defined

**Rationale**: SC-011 (zero console errors) provides baseline. Advanced observability can be added in monitoring phase.

### 🔧 Operational (P2)

- **CHK161**: Rollback strategy not defined
- **CHK162**: Incremental rollout not defined
- **CHK163**: Component deprecation strategy not defined

**Rationale**: These are process/deployment concerns, not requirements. Can be addressed in release planning.
