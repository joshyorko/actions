## Constitution Check (Re-validation)

### I. Library-First Action Design
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT (N/A - Frontend Enhancement)  
No change from initial assessment.

### II. CLI & HTTP-First Interface
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT (N/A - Frontend Enhancement)  
No change from initial assessment.

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Status**: ⚠️ REQUIRES ACTION (Unchanged)  
**Action Plan**:
- Phase 2 implementation MUST begin with failing tests for each component
- Tests must cover all states documented in data-model.md
- Visual regression tests (Playwright) must capture baseline screenshots
- Accessibility tests (jest-axe) must validate WCAG AA compliance
- Bundle size tests must validate ≤350KB limit

### IV. Contract & Integration Testing
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT (Component API Stability)  
**Validation Complete**:
- All component prop interfaces documented in contracts/components.d.ts
- Backward compatibility maintained (existing components remain unchanged)
- New components follow established patterns (Button as reference)

### V. Vendored Builds & Reproducible Releases
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT (N/A - No Vendoring)  
No change from initial assessment.

## Key Decisions Made in Phase 1

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library
2. **Visual Regression**: Playwright (screenshot comparison)
3. **Accessibility**: jest-axe + Lighthouse CI
4. **Bundle Size**: CI check with 350KB threshold

**Rationale**: Vitest is already integrated; Playwright is lightweight; jest-axe provides component-level a11y validation.

### Component State Management
- Use Tailwind state modifiers (`hover:`, `focus:`, `disabled:`) for CSS-driven states
- Use optional props (e.g., `error`) for explicit state overrides
- Leverage Radix UI's internal state management (no custom hooks needed)

**Rationale**: Keeps components simple, declarative, and aligned with Tailwind approach.

### Animation & Performance
- Use Tailwind `transition-*` utilities with `motion-reduce:` fallbacks
- 200ms duration for dialogs, 150ms for dropdowns (per spec)
- GPU-accelerated properties only (`transform`, `opacity`)

**Rationale**: Tailwind utilities are optimized for 60fps; motion-reduce respects user preferences.

### Color System
- Validated Tailwind palette for WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 minimum)
- Documented safe color pairings in data-model.md
- All badge variants meet AAA standard (7:1+)

**Rationale**: Ensures accessibility without custom color definitions.

## Implementation Order (Phase 2)

Based on component dependencies:

1. **Input, Textarea, Badge** (no dependencies)
2. **Loading, ErrorBanner** (depend on Button, already styled)
3. **Dialog** (depends on Button, Input, Textarea)
4. **Table** (depends on Badge, DropdownMenu)
5. **DropdownMenu** (depends on Button)

Each component implementation must follow Test-First workflow:
1. Write failing tests (unit + accessibility)
2. Implement component with Tailwind styling
3. Run tests (unit, visual regression, accessibility)
4. Validate bundle size and build time
5. Update quickstart.md with real examples

## Open Questions Resolved

All technical unknowns from the Technical Context are now resolved:

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Testing framework? | Vitest + React Testing Library (already installed) |
| Accessibility tools? | jest-axe + Lighthouse CI (to be added in Phase 2) |
| Visual regression? | Playwright (to be added in Phase 2) |
| Current component structure? | `src/core/components/ui/` (validated via exploration) |
| cn() utility location? | `src/shared/utils/cn.ts` (confirmed) |
| Tailwind config? | `tailwind.config.js` (confirmed, HSL variables available) |
| Build performance baseline? | 310KB (96KB gzipped), 2.5 min build (validated) |

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Bundle size exceeds 350KB limit
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: High (blocks release)  
**Mitigation**: 
- Estimated impact is ~5.4 KB for all changes
- CI check will fail if threshold exceeded
- Tailwind JIT mode only generates used classes

### Risk: Accessibility regressions from styling changes
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (WCAG AA compliance required)  
**Mitigation**:
- jest-axe tests will catch violations
- Lighthouse CI enforces 90+ score
- Radix UI primitives provide baseline accessibility

### Risk: Visual inconsistency across components
**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium (user experience degraded)  
**Mitigation**:
- Design tokens documented in data-model.md
- Visual regression tests capture baseline
- Code review enforces consistency

### Risk: Performance degradation on low-end devices
**Likelihood**: Low  
**Impact**: Medium (user experience on older devices)  
**Mitigation**:
- GPU-accelerated properties only
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Test on throttled CPU in Chrome DevTools

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Immediate Actions
1. **Add Test Dependencies**:
   - `@testing-library/react`
   - `@testing-library/user-event`
   - `jest-axe`
   - `@playwright/test`

2. **Configure CI**:
   - Add Lighthouse CI workflow
   - Add bundle size check (fail if >350KB)
   - Add visual regression workflow (Playwright)

3. **Begin Test-First Implementation**:
   - Start with Input component (no dependencies)
   - Write failing tests for all states (base, hover, focus, disabled, error)
   - Implement styling following data-model.md specifications
   - Validate with tests before moving to next component

### Phase 2 Deliverables (tasks.md)
The `/speckit.tasks` command will generate a detailed task breakdown including:
- Component-by-component implementation tasks
- Test writing tasks (unit, visual, accessibility)
- CI configuration tasks
- Documentation update tasks
- Acceptance criteria validation tasks

## Conclusion

Phase 1 (Design & Contracts) is **COMPLETE**. All technical unknowns have been resolved, component APIs are formally documented, and the implementation strategy is validated against Constitution principles.

- ✅ 8 component contracts defined
- ✅ WCAG AA compliance validated
- ✅ Bundle size impact estimated (~5.4 KB)
- ✅ Browser compatibility confirmed

- ✅ Implementation order determined
- ✅ Agent context updated

**Blockers**: None. Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (Implementation via `/speckit.tasks`).

**Constitution Compliance**: All principles satisfied except Test-First (requires action in Phase 2, as expected).
