## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review
✅ **Pass** - Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without implementation details
- Uses terms like "focus ring", "hover state", "animation" without specifying CSS classes or JavaScript
- Describes user outcomes rather than technical solutions
- All sections use business/user language

✅ **Pass** - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- User stories describe developer workflows in plain language
- Success criteria use measurable outcomes (time, percentage, score)
- No references to React, TypeScript, or Vite in requirements
- Technical context isolated to Assumptions and Dependencies sections

✅ **Pass** - All mandatory sections completed
- User Scenarios & Testing: ✅ (6 prioritized stories with acceptance criteria)
- Requirements: ✅ (20 functional + 14 component + 8 styling requirements)
- Success Criteria: ✅ (18 measurable outcomes)

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **Pass** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All requirements are concrete and specific
- No ambiguous placeholders remain
- Edge cases addressed with clear assumptions

✅ **Pass** - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Example: "FR-UI-002: Form inputs MUST show focus rings (blue-500 color, 2px offset)" - specific, measurable
- Example: "FR-UI-006: Dialogs MUST animate open/close with fade and scale effect over 200ms" - precise timing
- All requirements use "MUST" with clear conditions

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria are measurable
- SC-001: "within 50ms" - quantifiable
- SC-006: "350KB total (110KB gzipped)" - specific size limits
- SC-008: "Lighthouse Accessibility score achieves 90 or higher" - precise metric

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- Focus on user outcomes: "Users can complete primary workflows without visual confusion"
- Performance metrics stated as observable: "First Contentful Paint occurs within 1.5 seconds"
- Accessibility stated as standards compliance: "WCAG AA"

✅ **Pass** - All acceptance scenarios defined
- 6 user stories with 4-5 Given/When/Then scenarios each
- Total: 29 concrete acceptance scenarios
- Each scenario is independently testable

✅ **Pass** - Edge cases identified
- 8 edge cases documented covering:
  - Empty states (zero rows)
  - Overflow conditions (dialog content > viewport)
  - Accessibility preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
  - Responsive design (mobile viewports)
  - Performance boundaries (30 second timeout)

✅ **Pass** - Scope clearly bounded
- "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes:
  - Enterprise tier features
  - Dark mode
  - Backend changes
  - New dependencies
- "Assumptions" section documents constraints

✅ **Pass** - Dependencies and assumptions identified
- Dependencies: 6 items (Radix UI, Tailwind, Vite, React, TypeScript, cn utility)
- Assumptions: 10 items (browser support, architecture constraints, performance baselines)
- Risks: 5 identified with mitigation strategies

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **Pass** - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- Requirements map to user stories
- Each user story has 4-5 acceptance scenarios
- Requirements specify observable behavior (hover states, focus rings, animations)

✅ **Pass** - User scenarios cover primary flows
- P0 priorities: Forms, Tables, Dialogs (core interactions)
- P1 priorities: Dropdowns, System state (secondary interactions)
- P2 priorities: Micro-interactions (polish)
- All major UI components addressed

✅ **Pass** - Feature meets measurable outcomes
- 18 success criteria covering:
  - Performance (SC-006, SC-007, SC-014, SC-015)
  - Accessibility (SC-008, SC-009, SC-016, SC-017, SC-018)
  - User experience (SC-001, SC-002, SC-010, SC-012, SC-013)
  - Technical quality (SC-003, SC-004, SC-005, SC-011)

✅ **Pass** - No implementation details leak
- Spec references "focus rings" not "CSS outline property"
- Uses "smooth transitions" not "CSS transition: all 200ms ease-out"
- Describes "spinner animation" not "SVG with rotate keyframe"
- Timeline estimates reference phases, not specific files/modules

## Overall Status

**✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is:
- Complete and comprehensive
- Testable and unambiguous
- Focused on user value
- Free of implementation details
- Properly scoped with clear boundaries
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or implementation

## Notes

**Strengths**:
- Excellent prioritization (P0/P1/P2) enables incremental delivery
- Strong acceptance criteria with specific, measurable outcomes
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and accessibility requirements
- Clear separation of concerns (core vs enterprise, in-scope vs out-of-scope)
- Well-documented assumptions and risks

**Recommendations for Implementation**:
1. Start with P0 user stories (Forms, Tables, Dialogs) for immediate value
2. Use the 42 functional requirements as implementation checklist
3. Validate against 18 success criteria during QA
4. Consider visual regression testing given UI focus
5. Monitor bundle size throughout (SC-006: ≤350KB limit)
