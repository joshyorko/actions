## Summary

**Total Items**: 180  
**Focus Areas**: 
- Visual/UX Requirements (35% weight) - Styling, animations, interactions, visual states
- Accessibility Requirements (20% weight) - WCAG compliance, keyboard nav, screen readers
- Component Requirements (20% weight) - Props, interfaces, composition, states
- Performance Requirements (15% weight) - Bundle size, timing, rendering optimization
- Cross-cutting concerns (10% weight) - Security, maintainability, traceability

**Depth Level**: Formal Release Gate (maximum rigor)  
**Actor/Timing**: Release manager / QA lead before production deployment  
**Must-Have Coverage**: Constitution Test-First requirement validation (CHK159-CHK161), Visual state completeness (CHK001-CHK010), Accessibility coverage (CHK031-CHK040), Performance budgets (CHK021-CHK030)

**Next Steps**:
1. Review checklist items and mark completed requirements
2. Address gaps identified with [Gap] markers by updating spec.md
3. Resolve ambiguities marked with [Ambiguity] by quantifying vague terms
4. Fix conflicts marked with [Conflict] by aligning contradictory requirements
5. Run checklist again after spec updates to validate completeness

**Usage Note**: This checklist tests the QUALITY of the requirements documentation (spec.md), NOT the implementation. Each item asks "Are requirements clearly written?" rather than "Does the code work correctly?" Complete this before implementation begins to ensure requirements are ready for development.
