## Gaps & Ambiguities Summary

### Critical Gaps (Must Address)
1. **CHK010**: Not all component states documented
2. **CHK037**: ARIA attributes not specified
3. **CHK088**: Accessibility interaction scenarios missing
4. **CHK089**: Mobile viewport interaction scenarios missing

### Important Gaps (Should Address)
1. **CHK011**: HTML input types not enumerated
2. **CHK020**: TypeScript interfaces not specified
3. **CHK023**: GPU-accelerated properties not defined
4. **CHK030**: CSS purging not explicitly defined
5. **CHK051-55**: Animation easing curves, frame rates not specified
6. **CHK101-103**: Alternate flows for screen readers, touch, browser nav

### Ambiguities to Resolve
1. **CHK041**: "Smooth transition" - need easing functions
2. **CHK042**: "Clear visual separation" - need quantification
3. **CHK044**: "Prominent" - need definition
4. **CHK045**: "Professional polish" - need metrics
5. **CHK048**: "Functional elegance" - need criteria
6. **CHK154-156**: "Professional", "smooth", "clear" terminology
7. **CHK158**: "Standard connection" bandwidth/latency

### Non-Critical Gaps (Nice to Have)
1. **CHK124-125**: Advanced security (JSON injection, CSP)
2. **CHK127-129**: Maintainability documentation
3. **CHK132-134**: Extended compatibility requirements
4. **CHK135-136**: Observability (logging, error boundaries)
5. **CHK159, 161-163**: Error handling, rollback, deployment strategies

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Implementation)
1. ✅ Mark 96 complete items in checklist
2. 📝 Document the 84 incomplete items in spec updates
3. 🎯 Focus on Critical Gaps (10 items) - add to spec immediately
4. 🔍 Resolve key ambiguities (7 items) - quantify vague terms

### Spec Enhancement Priorities
**P0 (Block Implementation)**:
- Define all component states (CHK010)
- Specify ARIA attributes (CHK037)
- Add accessibility interaction scenarios (CHK088)
- Add mobile interaction scenarios (CHK089)

**P1 (Address Before Release)**:
- Enumerate HTML input types (CHK011)
- Define TypeScript interfaces (CHK020)
- Specify animation properties (CHK023, CHK051-55)
- Resolve terminology ambiguities (CHK154-158)

**P2 (Post-Release Refinement)**:
- Add maintainability guidelines (CHK127-129)
- Add extended compatibility (CHK132-134)
- Add observability requirements (CHK135-136)

### Validation Strategy
1. Complete checklist update (mark 96 ✅, document 84 ❌)
2. Update spec.md with P0 gaps
3. Re-run checklist validation
4. Proceed with Test-First implementation per Constitution
