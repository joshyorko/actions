# Tasks: Community UI Enhancement Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-community-ui-enhancement/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Tests are INCLUDED in this implementation per Constitution III (Test-First NON-NEGOTIABLE requirement)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Frontend: `action_server/frontend/src/`
- Tests: `action_server/frontend/__tests__/`
- Components: `action_server/frontend/src/core/components/ui/`

---

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Understand System State (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable developers to know when system is loading, when errors occur, and action status through clear visual feedback (spinners, error banners, status badges)

**Checkpoint**: Feature complete - all user stories working, tests passing, performance validated

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (T001-T006) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion (T007-T009)
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí US6)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete (T010-T063)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (US1 - Forms)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (US2 - Tables)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (but will integrate Badge from US5 later)
- **User Story 3 (US3 - Dialogs)**: Can start after Foundational - Uses Input/Textarea from US1 in forms (soft dependency)
- **User Story 4 (US4 - Dropdowns)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (uses existing Button component)
- **User Story 5 (US5 - State)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent, but integrates into all pages
- **User Story 6 (US6 - Animations)**: Depends on all other stories (applies polish across components)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (per Constitution III)
- Component implementation before page integration
- Core functionality before enhancements
- Story complete and independently testable before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different config files)
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T007, T008, T009 can run in parallel (different files)
- **US1 Tests**: T010, T011, T012, T013, T014 can all run in parallel (different test files)
- **US1 Implementation**: T015, T016 can run in parallel (different component files)
- **US2 Tests**: T019, T020, T021, T022 can all run in parallel
- **US2 Implementation**: T023, T024, T025 can run in parallel (same file, different components/functions)
- **US3 Tests**: T030, T031, T032, T033 can all run in parallel
- **US3 Implementation**: T034, T035, T036 can run in parallel (same file, but different sub-components)
- **US4 Tests**: T039, T040, T041 can all run in parallel
- **US4 Implementation**: T042, T043, T044 can run in parallel (same file, but different functions)
- **US5 Tests**: T047, T048, T049, T050, T051 can all run in parallel
- **US5 Implementation**: T052, T053, T054 can run in parallel (different component files)
- **US6 Tests**: T058, T059 can run in parallel
- **US6 Implementation**: T060, T061 can run in parallel (different components)
- **Polish**: T064, T065, T066, T069, T070 can run in parallel (different concerns)

**Full Parallel**: Once Foundational (Phase 2) completes, 6 different developers could work on US1-US6 simultaneously without conflicts

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Forms)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (Test-First):
Task: "T010 [P] [US1] Create Input component unit tests in __tests__/components/ui/Input.test.tsx"
Task: "T011 [P] [US1] Create Input accessibility tests in __tests__/a11y/Input.a11y.test.tsx"
Task: "T012 [P] [US1] Create Textarea component unit tests in __tests__/components/ui/Textarea.test.tsx"
Task: "T013 [P] [US1] Create Textarea accessibility tests in __tests__/a11y/Textarea.a11y.test.tsx"
Task: "T014 [P] [US1] Create visual regression tests in __tests__/visual/form-components.spec.ts"

# After tests fail, launch implementations:
Task: "T015 [P] [US1] Create Input component in src/core/components/ui/Input.tsx"
Task: "T016 [P] [US1] Create Textarea component in src/core/components/ui/Textarea.tsx"

# Then integrate sequentially:
Task: "T017 [US1] Update Actions.tsx to use Input component"
Task: "T018 [US1] Add form validation integration example in Actions.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only - P0 Priority)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T009) - CRITICAL checkpoint
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Forms (T010-T018)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Tables (T019-T029)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 - Dialogs (T030-T038)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P0 stories independently, validate accessibility, check bundle size
7. Deploy MVP if ready (forms, tables, dialogs working professionally)

### Full Feature (All User Stories)

1. Complete MVP (US1-US3)
2. Add Phase 6: User Story 4 - Dropdowns (T039-T046)
3. Add Phase 7: User Story 5 - State Indicators (T047-T057)
4. Add Phase 8: User Story 6 - Micro-interactions (T058-T063)
5. Complete Phase 9: Polish (T064-T071)
6. Final validation and deployment

### Parallel Team Strategy (3 Developers)

After completing Setup + Foundational together:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Forms) ‚Üí User Story 4 (Dropdowns)
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Tables) ‚Üí User Story 5 (State)
- **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Dialogs) ‚Üí User Story 6 (Animations)

Each developer owns their story end-to-end (tests ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí integration)

---

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability and independent testing
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **Test-First is MANDATORY** (Constitution III) - all tests must fail before implementation
- Verify tests fail, implement, verify tests pass before moving to next task
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Bundle size must stay ‚â§350KB (monitor with `npm run build` after each component)
- Accessibility tests must pass (Lighthouse score ‚â•90, jest-axe no violations)
- All animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Use existing cn() utility for className merging (no custom CSS unless necessary)
- No new npm dependencies beyond test tools (use existing Tailwind + Radix UI only)

---

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: All tests passing (unit, accessibility, visual regression), zero console errors
- **Performance**: Bundle ‚â§350KB (110KB gzipped), build time ‚â§5 minutes, FCP ‚â§1.5s, TTI ‚â§3.5s
- **Accessibility**: Lighthouse score ‚â•90, all contrast ratios ‚â•4.5:1 (WCAG AA), keyboard navigation 100% functional
- **User Experience**: All 6 user stories independently functional and testable, smooth animations (200ms), professional visual polish
- **Deliverables**: 8 enhanced/new components (Input, Textarea, Dialog, Table, DropdownMenu, Badge, Loading, ErrorBanner), 4 updated pages (Actions, RunHistory, Logs, Artifacts)
